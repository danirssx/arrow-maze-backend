# AI Usage Log: Project Setup

## Task / Problem

Create the initial backend repository configuration and governance scaffolding based on the project build guideline.

## Tool and Model

Codex / GPT-5.

## Prompt Used

The user asked Codex to build the project setup following `Build Completo del proyecto.md`, `Config de Agentes completa.md`, and the documentation guidance, with emphasis on configuration, build, agents, Zed, and Git worktrees.

## Result Obtained

Generated initial Node/Express/TypeScript configuration, Clean Architecture folders, lint/typecheck/test/build scripts, GitHub Actions, Docker support, Swagger base, Husky/Commitlint, AI usage templates, PR template, agent prompts, and worktree scripts.

## Team Modifications Pending Human Review

- Review dependency versions before freezing the baseline branch.
- Confirm the backend persistence decision before adding database adapters or auth use cases.
- Complete human modifications after reviewing this setup.

## Lessons / Limitations

The setup intentionally avoids auth, progress, leaderboard, level definitions, and persistence adapters because those require team approval under `AGENTS.md`.

## Critical Evaluation

### Approximate AI-Assisted Work

| Area | Estimate |
| --- | --- |
| Boilerplate and configuration | Pending |
| Pattern implementation | Pending |
| Backend business logic | Pending |
| Tests | Pending |
| Documentation | Pending |
| Architectural decisions | 0% unless explicitly approved by the team |

### AI Failure Cases

Pending. Add concrete cases discovered during reviews.

### Reflection

Pending. Complete before final delivery with what accelerated delivery, what required review, and what the team would do differently.
